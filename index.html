<p> I am currently learning to code with Code First Girls. Going over everything from how the internet works, to creating websites and version control with git. A lot to cover in only 8 weeks!
  Everyone should learn to code, here are some pretty good reasons why... </p>
<ol>
  <li>HTML is cool</li>
  <li>CSS is cooler</li>
  <li>JS is the best</li>
  </ol>
  
  <h2>What do you need to create a website?</h2>

  <p2>Not much!</p2>
<ul>
  <li> computer (always a good start)</li>
  <li>A text editor (I am using atom)</li>
  <li>A web browser (I am using chrome)</li>
  <li>Some HTML, CSS and JS files</li>
  </ul>
